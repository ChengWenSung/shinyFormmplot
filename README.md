# shinyFormmplot
just a practice how to use mmplot on Taiwan digital ability questionnaire

##There will be some encoding problems on Mac.

##The data file should be the same format as example.csv except numeric values and shiny could run.

##On my shiny app, user can choose 5 types of mmplot to plot.

##On dot or bar plot, you should have mean column.

##On dot with 95% cl or bar with 95% cl, you should have mean, Low_95, Up_95 column.

##On box plot, you should have median, Max, Min, Q1, Q3.

##I use Chineses county names to merge statistic data and geographical data and create mmplot.

##User can adjust the grouping numbers.

##User can text their own statistical panel name and x axis title.

##I restrict the objects user can specify and make novice easy to use.
